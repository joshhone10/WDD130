    <p>Hello! I'm a business management major from Blackfoot, ID. I enjoy playing board, card, and video games, specifically with friends. I also like to read and write. </p>
    <p> I love the culture of BYU-Idaho, and I love having the chance to spend time with my friends who are also up here. I am taking this class to brush up on some the HTML that I already know. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints since I turned 8. I love having a living prophet on the earth today.</p>
